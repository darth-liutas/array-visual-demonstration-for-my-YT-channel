# array-visual-demonstration-for-my-YT-channel
I run a small youtube channel in my native dialect (darja, a variation of arabic), and up to this point I've been explaining simple stuff, so I just drew them on a board and recoded that, + codes, but arrays i feel like i need to make this lil thing, gonna do the same for DSA and upcoming stuff, so i'll continue to build this project
